MathOCR Manual


Document recognition

(1) Choose "Document Recognition" in the menu "File"
(2) Select all page images in the dialog
(3) Interactive image preprocess(Can be skiped in preference)
	- Click "Crop" and two point in the image to crop image
	- Click "Mean Filter"、"Median Filter"、"kFill" or "Noise Remove" to apply corresponding filter
	- Click "Sauvola's method"、"Otsu's method" or "Manual" to apply corresponding threhold method(a must)
	- Click "Invert color" to invert image if "Check white on black" is not choosen or black pixels dominate the image
	- Click "Skew Detection" to detect skew using the current default skew detection method and show a guess in the text field below
	- Click two point in the image can also show skew angle guess given the two point determine the baseline
	- Click "Skew Correction" to rotate the image by specified radian(positive for anti-clockwise)
	- Click "Undo" to discard all changes
	- Click "Next" to enter next stage
(4) Interactive connected component analysis(Can be skiped in preference)
	- Click "Delete" and than a component's bounding box to delete it
	- Click "Merge" and than two components' bounding box to merge them
	- Click "Split vertically" and than a point in a component's bounding box to split it into two, a upper one and a lower one
	- Click "Split horizontally" and than a point in a component's bounding box to split it into two, a left one and a right one
	- Click "Clean page border" to remove all the components that is close to image border
	- Click "Next" to enter next stage
(5) Interactive physical analysis(Can be skiped in preference)
	- Page segment can be modidied in a way similar to (4) 
	- Click "Classify region" to detect block type automaticly
	- Click "Change type", choose a type and than click a block will change the type of the specified block
	- Click "Reading order sort" to sort the blocks
	- Click "Rearrange reading order" and than click the blocks one-by-one in expected order to rearrange the order of blocks
	- Click "Extract lines" to extract text line from text block
	- Click "Split line" and a point in a text line to split the text line into two
	- Click "Merge with next line" and than a text line to merge it the text line below
	- Click "Next" to enter next stage
(6) Interactive logical analysis(Can be skiped in preference)
	- Click to select a logical text block to be edited
	- Click "Delete" to delete the logical block selected
	- Choose type from a combo box
	- Change content in the text area
	- Click "Modify" to apply changes
	- Click "Next" to enter next stage
(7) Display output
	- Output format can be LaTeX or HTML


Mathematical formula recognition

(1) Choose "Formula Recognition" or "Formula Recognition(From screenshot)" in the menu "File"
(2) Choose image
	- If "Formula Recognition" is choosen, choose all formula images in the dialog
	- If "Formula Recognition(From screenshot)", select area from your screen using the red frame, and then click on top left corner of the frame
(3) Interactive image preprocess, just like that in document recognition
(4) Interactive connected component, just like that in document recognition
(5) Interactive character recognition(Can be skiped in preference)
	- Each symbol is shown, extra attention should be paid on those labeled in green
	- Move your mouse to a symbol and then the candidates will be shown together with a certainty
	- Choose "Delete" and click on a symbol, the recognition of the symbol will be deleted
	- Choose "Modify" and click on a symbol，then choose or create a symbol using through a dialog，the recognition of the symbol will be modified
	- Choose "Add" and click on two point, then choose or create a symbol using through a dialog, the region identified by the two point will be regarded as a symbol with recognition
	- Click "Next" to enter next stage
(6) Interactive structural analysis(Can be skiped in preference)
	- Each subexpression is shown
	- Click "Stepwise merge" will make a merge
	- Click "Next" to enter next stage
(7) Display output
	- Output format is LaTeX


Font training（for advanced user only）

(1) Choose "Font training" in the menu "Tool"
(2) Choose all the font files to be used，corresponding lists of character should located at the same directory with suffix replaced by ".nam"
(3) Generated data file will be placed in the same directory with suffix ".lg"
(4) If "Generate Characters Picture" is selected，pictures will be placed in the same directory with suffix ".png"
(5) If "Show Data" is selected, some information of the characters and glyphs will be shown in a table

注：
(1)List of character is a plain text file encoded in UTF-8，each character yield a line，containing code point，text mode LaTeX code and math mode LaTeX code，the format is like：
0x0041	A	A
(2)font size is measured in point


Preference

(1) Choose "Preference" from the menu "File"
(2) Modify settings
	-  For boolean options, select or un-select the checkbox
	-  For other options, change the value in the text field and than press enter，new value must meet requirement mentioned in tooltip text


Using MathOCR in command line

Usage:
java -jar MathOCR.jar -cli [options] files...
To learn more about the options, type:
java -jar MathOCR.jar -cli


Using MathOCR in your java program（for developer）

(1) Place the JAR file of MathOCR into classpath
(2) Import classes
import net.sf.mathocr.*;
import net.sf.mathocr.layout.*;
(*) Set parameter
Use the method of the object net.sf.mathocr.Environment.env
(3) Construct a Document object and add pages
Document doc=new Document();
while(/*there are more pages*/)
	doc.addPage(new Page(/*File, URL, InputStream or BufferedImage*/,doc));
(4) Get the recognition result
String result=BatchProcessor.recognize(doc,/*BatchProcessor.LATEX or BatchProcessor.HTML*/);

If you intend to recognize mathematical expression only instead of a document, replace (3) and (4) by
(3') BatchProcessor.recognizeFormula(bufferedImage);
